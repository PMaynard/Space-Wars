Mining Operations
==================

# Upgrades
- Mining Lasers (Varying Power requirements and ore yield)
- Hull upgrades (Amount of ore the ship can carry)
- Structure (Amount of kinetic damage the ship can take)
- Shields (Protect from debris and bad people)
- CPU (Used to control computers, lasers and shields) 
- Reactor (Power for the ship)
- Scanning computer (Identify which asteroid has ore, how much, skill needed)
- Targeting computer (Select an asteroid to mine and auto mine it)

# Hazards

## Uncharted Systems

- Sun going to explode
- Black Hole
- Exploding asteroids (Laser+gas=booom)
- Asteroids with gravity (need to divert power to engines to get away)

## Ship

- Systems overloading
- Malfunction
- Damaged systems
- Hackers (Asteroids make a good place bad people to hide)
